scala-orrery-example
====================

For a long time, basically since the beginning of Java,  I've used a simple orrery program as my ``Hello World'' 
for any new programming language, particularly an OO one.

This is sucn an exercise for Scala.   I don't expect its' even close to being idiomatic, but I'm able to
get it to run.


To run
