scala-orrery-example
====================

For a long time, basically since the beginning of Java, I've used a
simple orrery program as my ``Hello World'' for any new programming
language, particularly an object-oriented one.

This is sucn an exercise for Scala.  Hopefully, as I play with this
code it's getting closer and closer to being idiomatic.
